This R script is designed for performing differential expression analysis using the DESeq2 package, which is a powerful tool for analyzing count data from RNA-seq experiments. The goal of this script is to identify genes that have significantly different expression levels between different experimental conditions, such as healthy versus diseased samples. By leveraging statistical models, the script aims to provide insights into the underlying biological processes and potential therapeutic targets related to diseases.
