This script conducts pathway analysis to explore the biological processes linked to differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified through DESeq2 and EdgeR methods. It loads DEG data from CSV files, converts Ensembl gene IDs to Entrez IDs, and performs KEGG pathway enrichment analysis using the clusterProfiler package. The results are saved as separate CSV files for each method, and the script generates bar plots illustrating the top 20 enriched pathways. To use this script, ensure you have R installed along with the necessary packages: tidyverse, readr, clusterProfiler, org.Hs.eg.db, and biomaRt.
