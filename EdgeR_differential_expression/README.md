This script conducts differential gene expression analysis using EdgeR in R. It starts by installing and loading necessary packages, reading RNA-seq count data, and setting up metadata for the analysis. The data is cleaned, normalized, and filtered to retain genes with sufficient expression levels. A model is then fitted to identify differentially expressed genes between conditions. The results are visualized using volcano and MA plots to highlight significant changes. The script also annotates the genes with symbols and exports the top differentially expressed genes for further examination.
