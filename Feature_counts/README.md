This script counts how many RNA-seq reads match each gene in a genome. It works with two types of data: single-end and paired-end. For both types, it uses a reference file (GTF or GFF) that shows where the genes are located. The script creates folders for the results, counts the reads using multiple computer threads to speed up the process, and saves the results in separate files for single-end and paired-end data. When the counting is done, it shows a message saying the process is complete.
